# Goal
To determine which factors are most relevant in a tennis match and use them to predict a winner

# Overview
I am an avid tennis fan. I love playing it, watching it, and talking about it. Surprisingly, there is a lack of consistent
and in-depth statistics around this game. Sports fans have seen how advanced metrics in football, baseball, and even basketball
have revolutionized the game for players and fans alike. So, in light of this fact, I wanted this project to try and take a
closer look at what features are most influential towards winning a match and be able to leverage them in such a way to
draw meaningful answers that answer the question, *"What wins a tennis match?"*

# Dataset
This project turned in to an excellent example of how the correct data is needed to drive home relevant and significant
results. As I mentioned before, there is not an extensive database that holds much beyone the most basic of tennis statsistics. Coming to this realization resulted in the project goal changing multiple times. The original goal of this project was to be able to create an in match win prediction to be able to predict the winner of a match between any two opponents at any stage of the match. In order to do this I needed to come up with an initial match prediction prior to the match even starting. This is where my first project pivot occured as I was not able to get a substantial head-to-head match result.
